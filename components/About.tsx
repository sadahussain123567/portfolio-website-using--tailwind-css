              I&apos;m Saddam Hussain, a front-end web developer with a strong
              interest in making websites that are both aesthetically pleasing
              and easy to use. I have set out to turn my passion for coding into
              useful digital solutions. I&apos;ve developed my HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript skills during and after my academic career, with a
              special interest in frameworks like React.js. My dedication to
              studying and utilizing the newest web technologies is demonstrated
              by my projects, which include an intuitive to-do list application,
              a dynamic weather app, and a responsive calculator. I enjoy
              challenges that force me to be creative and innovative in my
              problem-solving. Every project I work on improves my technical
              skills and reaffirms my commitment to producing clear, effective
              code that improves user experience. Right now, I&apos;m excited to
              help
